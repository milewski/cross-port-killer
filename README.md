Kill the process running on a given TCP port on **Windows**, **Linux** and **Mac**

## Install

```bash
$ npm install cross-port-killer -D
```

## Usage

```js
import { kill, killer } from 'cross-port-killer';

kill(9090).then(pids => {
  console.log(pids)
})

// you could also kill pids manually if you know them... this would save you bringing up another lib, you are welcome.

killer.killByPid(12345).then(() => console.log('done'))
killer.killByPids([12345, 54321]).then(() => console.log('done'))
```
This lib also comes with a `CLI`.

To kill any process occupying the port 9090 you can run:

```bash
$ npx cross-port-killer 9090
```

or

```bash
$ npm install cross-port-killer -g
```
```bash
$ kill-port 9090
```

## Dependencies

On **Linux**/**Mac** this library depends on `lsof` in case you don't have it installed (perhaps you are using docker?) run:

```bash
$ apt-get install lsof
```

On **Mac**, It comes with the OS by default so nothing to worries.
